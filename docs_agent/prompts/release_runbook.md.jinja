## Deployment Procedures

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment
```bash
# 1. Verify production environment status
kubectl get pods -n production
kubectl get services -n production

# 2. Create backup
kubectl exec -n production deployment/database -- pg_dump > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# 3. Verify rollback capability
kubectl rollout history deployment/app -n production
```

### Step 2: Database Migration
```bash
# 1. Apply database migrations
kubectl exec -n production deployment/app -- python manage.py migrate

# 2. Verify migration success
kubectl exec -n production deployment/app -- python manage.py showmigrations

# 3. Run data validation scripts
kubectl exec -n production deployment/app -- python scripts/validate_data.py
```

### Step 3: Application Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy new application version
kubectl set image deployment/app app=app:{{ idea.version }} -n production

# 2. Monitor deployment progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n production

# 3. Verify deployment success
kubectl get pods -n production
kubectl logs -f deployment/app -n production
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Validation
```bash
# 1. Health check endpoints
curl -f https://api.{{ idea.context.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '') }}.com/health
curl -f https://api.{{ idea.context.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '') }}.com/ready

# 2. Smoke tests
python scripts/smoke_tests.py --environment=production

# 3. Performance validation
python scripts/performance_check.py --environment=production
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
- Health check failures (>3 consecutive failures)
- Error rate threshold exceeded (>5% for 5 minutes)
- Response time degradation (>2x baseline for 5 minutes)
- Database connection failures

### Manual Rollback Commands
```bash
# 1. Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app -n production

# 2. Monitor rollback progress
kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n production

# 3. Verify rollback success
kubectl get pods -n production
kubectl logs -f deployment/app -n production

# 4. Database rollback (if needed)
kubectl exec -n production deployment/app -- python manage.py migrate {{ idea.version }}
```

### Rollback Validation
- [ ] Application health restored
- [ ] Database integrity verified
- [ ] User functionality confirmed
- [ ] Performance metrics normalized
- [ ] Stakeholder notification sent

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
{% for kpi in idea.kpis %}
- {{ kpi }} performance
{% endfor %}
- Application response time
- Error rates and types
- Database performance
- Infrastructure health

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical:** Application down, database unavailable
- **High:** Error rate >10%, response time >5s
- **Medium:** Error rate >5%, response time >2s
- **Low:** Performance degradation, resource usage

### Monitoring Tools
- **Application:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Infrastructure:** CloudWatch, DataDog
- **Logs:** ELK Stack, CloudWatch Logs
- **Alerts:** PagerDuty, Slack

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. **Immediate Action:** Assess impact and notify stakeholders
2. **Investigation:** Gather information and identify root cause
3. **Resolution:** Execute fix or rollback procedure
4. **Communication:** Update stakeholders and users
5. **Post-Incident:** Document lessons learned

### Emergency Contacts
- **Release Manager:** [Phone] [Email]
- **Technical Lead:** [Phone] [Email]
- **DevOps Engineer:** [Phone] [Email]
- **Database Administrator:** [Phone] [Email]
- **Stakeholder:** [Phone] [Email]

### Escalation Matrix
- **Level 1:** On-call engineer (0-30 minutes)
- **Level 2:** Technical lead (30-60 minutes)
- **Level 3:** Release manager (60-120 minutes)
- **Level 4:** Executive stakeholders (120+ minutes)

## Post-Release Activities

### Monitoring Period
- **Immediate (0-2 hours):** Continuous monitoring and validation
- **Short-term (2-24 hours):** Regular health checks and performance monitoring
- **Long-term (1-7 days):** User feedback collection and performance analysis

### Success Criteria
